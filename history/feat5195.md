* SeanHall: WIXFEAT:5195 - **BREAKING CHANGE** Changed bundle version to Major.Minor.0.BuildNumber. This allows us to publish updates as Major.Minor.(GreaterThanZero).BuildNumber. MSI product version numbers remain Major.Minor.BuildNumber so major upgrades continue to work. This bundle will not upgrade from build v4.0.4305.0. If you've installed v4.0.4305.0, you must uninstall before installing a later bundle.
